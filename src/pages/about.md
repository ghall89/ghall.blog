My name is **Graham**, a web developer from Rhode Island.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually enjoying one of my other hobbies; video games, music, hiking, photography, art, the list goes on...

I also like writing about stuff, so I put together this site to share whatever's on my mind about the world of tech, gaming, life, web development, and whatever else strikes my fancy.

If your interested in checking out my web dev projects, check out [my portfolio](https://ghall.dev/).

If you want to get in touch, I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://home.social/@ghalldev">Mastodon</a>.

My portrait was drawn by [Natalia Vazquez](https://www.nataliavazquezgarcia.com).
