title: "Next.js 13 and Exploring New Technologies"

Next.js 13 was launched a few days ago ([More details here!](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13)), and I’ve been slowly working my way through the new stuff. As a relative newcomer to the world of Next.js I’m very excited by what I see, but I also don’t want to get too bogged down in what’s new because I’m already feeling a little bombarded with new stuff at my day job. Besides, it might be a while before I get to use Next.js 13 in a professional setting.

Yes I’m a tech nerd, and I become easily enamoured with the shiny new thing, perhaps to a fault, especially when that shiny new thing is a piece of software. I’m the guy who installs OS updates on day one—MacOS Ventura seems to be running fine so far, _knock on wood_—and I just want to just dive head-first into Next.js 13.

But, when you’re as new to the industry as I am, there are already so many new tools and technologies to learn it can already seem overwhelming without throwing in trying to keep up with the latest in the ever-evolving world of web development.

My attitude is embrace the curiosity, but focus on mastering the tools you’re currently using on a daily basis. Whether you’re using an entirely different set of frameworks,, or if you’re like me and just using an older version of Next.js, the new shiny stuff will still be there when you’re ready. And possibly, by the time you’re ready, an even newer, shinier technology will be around for you to check out.
