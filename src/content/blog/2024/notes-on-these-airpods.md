My big purchase from the iPhone event a couple weeks ago was the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation[^1].

I've only had them a few days at this point, and writing product reviews isn't my strong suite, so I've collected up some notes on my experience with the new AirPods' audio modes:

## Noise Cancellation

I've never owned a set of headphones with noise cancellation so I don't really have anything to compare these to, but I feel like it works pretty well considering there are no rubber tips (and thus no seal to fully block out external noise).

I've tried them when working at my desk and it does a real good job of blocking out most ambient noise, and I feel less distracted. I've also tried them working in a crowded cafe, and while I could still hear the chatter of the people around me, it was muffled enough to minimize any distraction.

Speaking on the phone or in meetings is still a bit strange and I feel like I have to shout. Might default to turning off noise cancellation in these situations if I don't adapt.

## Passthrough

I found the passthrough on the AirPods 4 to be a little unsettling since I was hearing ambient noise naturally as well as through the headphones. This made ambience a bit more grating. Not sure if I'll use passthrough mode, and just stick to either "active noise cancellation" or "off".

## Misc Notes

They don't feel quite as secure in my ear as the AirPods 3, but still way better than the AirPods 1 and 2.

The AirPods 3 had an issue with stuttering music when I was using my MacBook in clamshell mode but that seems to not be an issue so far with these.
