An updated version of [this post](/posts/2023/default-apps-2023) from 2023, inspired by [this post](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/25/default-apps-2023/) from Chris Coyier (which was in turn inpsired by [this post](https://mattcool.tech/posts/default-apps-2023)).

I changed up some of the categories to avoid any entries with "none" or "N/A".
