For my very first Blog Question Challenge, I've been tagged by [Kyle](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/02/blog-questions-challenge-music-edition) to answer questions about music. This is going to be a bit of a challenge, but here we go...

## What Are 5 Of Your Favorite Albums?

There are so many albums I'd consider favorites, narrowing them down to just 5 seems like an impossible task. Here's the 5 I've whittled my list down to, with the disclaimer that I don't necessarily like them more than other albums that didn't make the cut.

- The Else - They Might Be Giants
- Ocean Eyes - Owl City
- Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand
- Hey, I'm Just Like You - Tegan and Sara
- White Blood Cells - The White Stripes

## What Are 5 Of Your Favorite Songs?

Ditto for songs, but 100x more difficult...

- Synopsis for Latecomers - They Might Be Giants
- What Feels Like Eternity - Metric
- The Last Great American Dynasty - Taylor Swift
- This is Why - Paramore
- Good Morning Tucson - Jonathan Coulton

## Favorite Instrument(s)?

I used to play the trumpet, so that's probably my favorite. After that, probably keyboard because I think it would be fun to play.

## What Song Or Album Are You Currently Listening To?

As I write this, I am listening to Pok√© & Chill, which is an album of lo-fi renditions of music from the Pok√©mon video games.

## Do You Listen To The Radio, And If So, How Often?

I don't listen to the radio at all anymore. The one station I did listen to closed and got sold off years ago, and so my days of listening to the radio ended.

## How Often Do You Listen To Music?

Almost constantly. I sometimes substitute it out for podcasts, but I'm generally listening to music while I work, clean, or just relax. I also listen to music while I write, but I generally only listen to various lo-fi albums.

## How Often Do You Discover Music And How Do You Discover It?

I don't discover as much new music as I would like to, but when I do it's through Apple Music in the New section, or from listening to some of their recommended playlists.

## What‚Äôs A Song Or Album You Enjoy That You Wish Had More Recognition?

I'm absolutely 100% biased here since I know the artist, but my pick is [Here's to the Sojourners](https://album.link/i/1598277466) by Nathan Landis Funk. Cool music by a cool guy.

## What‚Äôs Your Favorite Song Of All Time?

This answer changes constantly, but at the moment I'd have to pick Birdhouse in Your Soul by They Might Be Giants. It's perhaps an odd choice, but it never fails to cheer me up when I'm feeling down and that's enough to cement it as my favorite...for the moment.

## Has Your Taste Of Music Evolved Over The Years?

I'd say it's expanded quite a bit, and I'd even say changed slighlty. I had a very limited taste in high school, and, while I still do like a lot of the music I listened to then, as my tastes have expanded I've found myself perferring a lot of different artists and genres. "Alternative" is still the most common genre in my Apple Music library, but over the last 16 years I've added electronic, folk, grunge, K-pop, and "singer/songwriter" (though I'm still not entirely sure what that means as a genre ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

So, after much overthinking, those are my answers to these musical questions. Thanks again to Kyle for tagging me. I'm tagging [Mark @ CodeMacLife](https://blog.codemaclife.net), good luck!
