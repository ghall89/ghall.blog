Ever since I started using Mastodon, I've become a lot more interested in reducing the presence of algorithmic content in my digital life. I've never been particularly thrilled with algorithmic feeds of content. I was among the people who was quite furious when Instagram ditched the chronological timeline, and then started inserting content from accounts I didn't even follow.

Somewhere along the line, I think I just started accepting what I assumed was inevitable. I think I was probably naive, and didn't consider the ills â€“ both social and psychological â€“ that resulted algorithmically curated content. It was just an annoying thing that I just had to accept.

Mastodon reminded me that not only do things not have to be this way, but connecting with people more naturally online is, at least in my experience, a lot more meaningful. I can't tell you the name of a single person I interacted with on Twitter, but I will always remember the small number of infinitely more meaningful connections I've made on Mastodon. With the exception of a couple friends I made on Reddit during Covid lockdown, I don't think I really formed any memorable or meaningful connections online since the App.net days.

Not too long after joining Mastodon I started using an RSS reader for my news once again, something I hadn't considered since the Google Reader days (RIP). It not only gave me the freedom to curate my news feed myself, picking the articles I found interesting or important rather than letting Google News spoon feed me what it thought I'd want to read, but it also got me to follow blogs again.

Most recently, I decided to totally restructure how I consume YouTube content. At some point, probably around the time YouTube started prioritizing suggested content over subscriptions, I picked up the habit of just watching what they put in front of my face. I lost touch with a lot of cool creators whos content was meaningful for me. So I went through my subscriptions, added those channels' RSS feeds to my RSS reader of choice ([Reeder](https://reeder.app) if you're curious), and deleted my Google account. We'll see how it goes longer term, but for right now I couldn't be happier with my choice.

Being the curator of your own online experience is a bit more of a cognitive load at first, but I think the empowerment it provides is more than worth the initial investment. The connections and content you mindfully choose to engage with are far more meaningful and enriching than any algorithm that's designed to consume your attention for as long as possible.

There are no shortage of tools out there to help you curate your online experience. In addition to an RSS reader, check out independent Podcast clients (my personal favorite is [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)). If you're on Mastodon or Bluesky, follow hashtags for topics that interest you and join in on the conversation (and, of course, be kind when you do ðŸ™‚).
