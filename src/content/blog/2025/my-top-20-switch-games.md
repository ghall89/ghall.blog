Itâ€™s crazy that the Nintendo Switch has been around for 8 years now. While I didnâ€™t get the Switch until about a year after it released, I think it just might be the console that Iâ€™ve played regularly for the longest amount of time (just barely edging out the Nintendo 3DS), and as such will always have a special place in my heart. Even with the Switch 2 on the horizon, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m ready to move on.

The Switch is also the console Iâ€™ve played the most games on, so I thought it would be fun to go through and rank my personal top 20 games that I played on the system. Because Iâ€™m posting this on the Internet, I should give the disclaimer that this is my own purely subjective selection of games that are meaningful to me personally. There may be objectively better games than some of the ones on this list, but I either havenâ€™t played them or they werenâ€™t as personally meaningful to me.

Also, I listed them in alphabetical order partly because I couldnâ€™t decide on a ranking, but mostly because it makes my brain happy. ðŸ§ 

* A Short Hike
* Animal Crossing: New Horizons
* Fire Emblem Engage
* Hades
* Kirby and the Forgotten Land
* The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
